# Project Achelois

This is my game made for Ludum Dare 48. Everything was created by me in 48 hours (apart from the font). Uncover the secrets of Europa!

## Where to play

You can play the HTML5 build of the game here - https://dzejpi.itch.io/project-achelois.

## How to open ...?
### Game
In order to open the game, you need to have a Game Maker. This game was made using GML only - no drag and drop, so don’t search for it! I personally do not like the drag and drop, because it makes the interface clunky and confusing. And coding it directly is often quicker anyway.

### Graphic assets
All graphic assets and their project files are in the `_graphics` folder. Due to the nature of Ludum Dare, assets can be a little disorganised and a lot of assets were edited after exported, so sometimes you can notice they are different from the project file.

### Music & Sounds
You can find all music and sound resources in the `_sound` folder. If you want to check the music and sound project files, you will need:

* FL Studio; I have the Producer Edition v20.8.3.
* These plugins installed:
  * Kairatune - completely free.
  * VST Speek 3 - completely free.
  * Fruity DrumSynth Live - included in FL Studio.

Although you will probably not find anything interesting. Most of the sounds/music were made in a very crude way using presets. Kairatune’s presets are interesting enough on their own and great for doing ambient music.

#### Where are all S.A.M. dialogs in FL Studio?
You will not find them in the FL Studio project. The text in the VST Speek 3 is always the same for one audio track (or at least I haven’t found a way to do it with patterns). Dialogs were made by simply copying them from Game Maker, exporting, copying another one, exporting, and so on. So you will only see the last voice I exported.
